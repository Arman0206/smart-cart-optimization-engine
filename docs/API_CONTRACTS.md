}
```

### Get Cart Items For a User
`GET /cart?userId=user123`

Response (200): Array of cart items, with `productId` populated with full product details:
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "66f8b2c3d4e5f6789012345",
    "userId": "user123",
    "productId": {
      "_id": "66f8a1b2c3d4e5f678901234",
      "productName": "Laptop",
      "category": "Electronics",
      "brand": "Dell",
      "price": 60000,
      "rating": 4.5
    },
    "quantity": 2,
    "createdAt": "2026-07-07T12:05:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

**Note for recommendation-service:** since `productId` is populated here, this endpoint is the easiest way to get a user's current cart contents along with full product info in a single call — useful for `coreServiceClient.js`.

### Remove Item From Cart
`DELETE /cart/:id`

Response (200):
```json
{ "message": "Item removed from cart" }
```

## Error Responses

All errors follow this shape:
```json
{ "message": "Description of the error" }
```
Common status codes: `400` (bad request / missing field), `404` (not found), `500` (server error).
